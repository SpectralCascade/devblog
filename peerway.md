I am developing [Peerway](https://github.com/SpectralCascade/peerway), a peer-to-peer social media app for mobile that stores user data locally instead of using a central database.
This is as part of a student research project I am conducting at Cardiff University, titled "Data Anarchy: Building A Social Media Platform Where Users Control Their Data".
The aim of this research is to determine whether such a platform could be a viable alternative to traditional social media platforms and compare differences relating to key issues such as data privacy.

You can have a couple of options to take part:
1. Fill out a Google Forms questionnaire, or
2. Participate in an Zoom call interview with me

Taking part will involve installing the app, answering some questions and carrying out 6 tasks using various features of the app.

If you can take part in an interview, please do get in touch with me via lanetn@cardiff.ac.uk - it makes it easier for me to clarify questions and tasks as well as giving me real-time feedback on your experience using the app. If you do wish to take the interview however, please do not fill in the questionnaire as the interview will cover those questions and tasks.

All the details you need to know are available in this [Participant Information Sheet](PIS.pdf).
If you don't want to participate in an interview but you are happy to complete the questionnaire, please go ahead and fill it out at [https://forms.gle/z53bRQFw9F7gbDUaA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRbrLdmNJsRg91ER6oMjDKGFwcmnFvLv4tFesZpBpFHrxd-g/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### Non-interview participants only: Instructions for installing and running the app
To do this you *must* have a working Android device.
1. [Tap here](https://github.com/SpectralCascade/peerway/releases/download/peerway-2022.05.07.a1/peerway-2022.05.07.a1.apk) to download the app to your Android device
2. Open the file once it is downloaded to install it. You may be asked to give permission to trust apps/APK files from 3rd parties - if so, you need to follow the link to do so before the app can be installed.
3. Once you have installed the app, it should appear under your apps named Peerway. Tap on the icon to run the app.
