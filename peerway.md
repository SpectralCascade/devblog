I am developing [Peerway](https://github.com/SpectralCascade/peerway), a peer-to-peer social media app for mobile that stores user data locally instead of using a central database.
This is as part of a student research project I am conducting at Cardiff University, titled "Data Anarchy: Building A Social Media Platform Where Users Control Their Data".
