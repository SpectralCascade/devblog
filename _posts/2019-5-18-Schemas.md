title: Serialisation and Schemas in Ossium
---

Hello! Today I'm going to chat about a paradigm used in data-driven game engine design: the type schema.
I'm currently working on [Ossium, a small 2D game engine](https://ossiumengine.net); it's a pretty self-contained
game engine, providing an interface for managing disparate systems and game object data.
One of the key features in Ossium is a [serialisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) system
that allows me to convert a game object (or even a bog standard class) into a JSON string.
This forms the foundation for data-driven game design in the engine, as it will allow me to tweak property values of
game objects without touching the code to some degree, which is great for rapid prototyping and general game development.

The JSON format is great, as it represents data in key-value pairs which is how almost all game engines represent data.
For instance, Valve's Hammer Editor represents the properties of entities as simple key-value fields.

The serialisation system in the Unity engine uses a similar representation, with public members of objects displayed
in a key-value format where the member name is the key, and the data field shows the member's value.

Design like this is practically universal in engines where not all data is hardcoded into the game,
perhaps with the exception of small, primitive engines that rely on purely sequential formats
(such as raw binary) to store information about game objects outside of the runtime environment.

Of course, how these key-value fields are defined varies greatly between engines, and sometimes there is a huge
difference between the runtime representation and the external, persistent data representation. Some engines
use _variants_ to bridge this gap, which effectively abstracts the type of a variable such that the variable could be a string,
a number, a boolean - whatever - and this type is not resolved until the variant is actually used.
This is powerful if one wants to dynamically add or remove properties from a game object, without necessarily modifying
code directly. However, while this is very useful during development, in many cases field definitions are not created
or removed at game runtime. This makes variants somewhat unnecessary for most entities. Variants also add more
complexity and overhead to the code, especially in a language that does not inherently support complex variants such as C++
(instead you must use an implementation like `std::variant`, which often requires a lot of boiler-plate code to use).

Some engines use what is known as a _schema_ to define the key-value properties outside of the runtime
environment. A schema basically defines the property fields of an object, much like members of a class,
but might be defined outside of the runtime environment. These schemas are then used to determine how properties are
represented in, say, an editor, e.g. showing a dropdown list for enumerated data types, or perhaps a colour picker
for setting custom colour values. The schema properties can then be implemented at runtime using variants. This allows
game designers to create a schema which specifies the properties of an entity, without a programmer creating a whole
new class. Some engines support a high-level scripting language, so a game designer can even program entities themselves.
In fact, a game engine may even determine the behaviours of an entity by itself without ANY additional scripting.
For instance, if a designer creates a schema that has a health property, the engine could automagically apply logic
to the entity, such as reducing the entity's health when it gets hit and destroying the entity when it's health runs out.
This would let a designer churn out a whole bunch of different monsters or enemies pretty easily.

Ossium's schema system is very simple as it doesn't support a high-level scripting language or deterministic behaviour
based on properties. In fact, it doesn't even use variants. The system works in a similar manner to the Unity and Unreal
engines, in the sense that all the properties are defined as members of a class within the code itself.
Due to the lack of [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)) in C++ (for now!),
there is some boiler-plate code required to make the class serialisable, much like the Unreal engine. However, unlike Unreal,
there is NO externally generated code - everything is done with classes and macros so you can just hit compile and things
_should_ work out of the box, provided you're using a compiler with `std=c++17` enabled.

**How to use the Schema system in Ossium**

To create a schema in Ossium, you must declare a class or struct that inherits from the `Schema` template. For example,
let's say we're making a `Monster` class:

~~~
struct MonsterSchema : public Schema<MonsterSchema>
{
    DECLARE_SCHEMA(MonsterSchema, Schema<MonsterSchema>);
    
    M(int, health) = 50;
    
    M(int, damage) = 10;

    M(vector<string>, inventory);
    
};

class Monster : public MonsterSchema
{
public:
    CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA(SchemaRoot, MonsterSchema);
    
    // ...
    
};
~~~


The struct `MonsterSchema` is our actual schema. It inherits from the Schema template class, with it's own type
passed in as the type argument; the `Schema` template class defines a whole bunch of methods and static storage for
meta data about the members, such as their names. Within the struct itself, we must use the `DECLARE_SCHEMA()` macro,
passing in the schema type and the inherited type. This macro declares some additional meta data unique to the schema type.

The members of the schema must be wrapped in the `M()` macro if you wish for those members to be serialisable,
with the member's type first, followed by it's name. The basic functionality is identical to declaring a member variable,
so you can assign a default value; in addition to declaring the variable however, the macro declares a unique static
object that is used to setup string conversion of the member's data, with correct type casting. As long as the member type
is supported by a `ToString()` and `FromString()` function, you can use any type. At present Ossium supports basic data types
and some standard data types such as `std::vector` out of the box; if a type isn't supported, the code will still compile but
you will not be able to serialise the member unless you implement a `ToString()` and `FromString()` function or method
for that specific type.

Finally, we create a separate class for the implementation of our actual `Monster` where we'll can have any members we don't
want to serialise with the schema. It inherits from `MonsterSchema` and uses the `CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA()` macro, which declares
a whole bunch of methods for accessing and serialising members from the class and the base schema class. In this case,
the `Monster` class doesn't inherit from any other classes that implement a schema, so we pass the `SchemaRoot` type which
acts as a placeholder as the first argument, followed by the type of schema we are implementing (in this case `MonsterSchema`).

That's it! The system isn't too complicated to use, so it should be fairly easy to get the hang of.

_But what if I want to make a class with it's own schema that inherits from _`Monster`_!?_ I hear you cry!

Never fear! The process is the same. For example, let's say we make a special class called `Blob` that
inherits from `Monster` and implements a schema called `BlobSchema`:

~~~
struct BlobSchema : public Schema<BlobSchema>
{
    DECLARE_SCHEMA(BlobSchema, Schema<BlobSchema>);
    
    M(float, blobbiness) = 1.0f;
    
    M(string, name) = "Mr Blob";
    
};

class Blob : public Monster, public BlobSchema
{
public:
    CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA(Monster, BlobSchema);
    
    // ...
    
};
~~~

This time, because we inherit from `Monster` which implements it's own schema, we pass the `Monster` type as the first
argument in the `CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA()`, followed by the schema we just inherited from which is `BlobSchema` in this case.
Now we have a `Blob` class that can be serialised including the schema we inherited via `Monster`. Ta-da!
